			<hr> <h2>About me</h2> <hr>
			<p>I am currently a senior and majoring in Business Economics with a minor in Digital Humanities at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
			<p>My background includes serving as a customer service associate within both retail environments and student center. In these positions, I provided quality customer service in a fast-paced, high volume establishment. I demonstrated the ability to work as a team to resolve a variety of issues and complaints. My coursework in management, accounting, finance, investment has provided me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I have been working on some digital humanities projects on topics such as indigenous studies, the holocaust, and user experience design by applying digital research methods learned in minor coursework. I also have experience working on website design for my team projects for both research and product design presentations, where I can develop my collaborative and creative skills.
